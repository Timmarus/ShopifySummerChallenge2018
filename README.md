This is my entry for the Shopify Backend Internship challenge for Summer 2018.

There are many different ways to approach this problem. My solution uses a Menu object
that functions as a directed graph/n-ary tree.

To use, just run ShopifyBackendChallenge.py with the Python interpreter, and it will automatically
spit out the values from both id=1 and id=2 challenges, as given on the challenge page.
